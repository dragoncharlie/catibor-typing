  "Playtime helps not only with physical health, but with mental/emotional health as well. It's a great way to increase a timid cat's confidence, ease stress and build trust between the two of you. Interactive playtime is a valuable addition to other training and behavior work you're doing with your cat.",
  "If there's one meme that even non-cat owners know about feline friends, it's \"if it fits, I sits.\" Cats love to climb in boxes and bags and will even lay down on top of carpet squares or a taped-off section of the floor. But if you're bringing a new kitty into your home or helping a timid one adjust, having places to hide is even more important.",
  "It is a common misconception that cats are antisocial and prefer being left alone. While some cats are more independent than others, they all benefit from spending time with their owners. They need playtime and social interaction - especially as kittens. Just like puppies, young kittens should be exposed to different people, animals, and social situations. This helps them grow into happy, well-adjusted adults.",
  "Cats love climbing and peering down on their kingdoms from high perches. Being high up creates a sense of comfort and security. And in multi-cat households, height allows felines to establish dominance without physical aggression. Climbing comes naturally to cats, and maximizing the vertical space in your home can also help your cat stay physically fit.",
  "Like climbing, scratching is a natural behavior for cats. They do it to care for their nails and to mark their territory. And if you don't provide an appropriate place for your cat to scratch, they will choose a spot, or several spots, to destructively scratch on their own. If you don't want claw marks on your sofa, door frames, or curtains, buy a few scratching posts and place them around your home."
